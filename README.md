## **Purpose**

This website has been built and designed for the sole purpose of my first project through the code institute course. I have been tasked with making a front end website using basic code that I have learnt over the last month, including HTML and CSS. A completed list of technologies can be found in the '[Technology Used](#Technology-Used)' section of this Readme.md

For this website I have decided to design a website based on a hobby close to my heart, Taekwon-Do, after having practiced this sport for almost 20 years, I felt that as a beginning project, it would serve me well if I knew what I was talking about, instead of trying to design a website for something entirely new.
***
## Brief

Misfits Martial Arts, Misfits MA. The end goal of this project is to create a website in which a new potential customer can navigate easily, and quickly access the information that they would require to become a new member of the club. At the same time I want to make the website user friendly to those who are already members of the club, and keep them coming back to the site.
***
### **What I entend to include;**

- A simple homepage from which the potential customer can easily navigate to other pages on the site, or be directed towards their social media links.
- An introduction to the club, for example an *'about us'* section, a quick video to engage with, and possibly upcoming events to engage the customer with.
- Where and when to attend a class, as turning up to the class is usually the hardest part!
- A form for the customer to contact the club with any further questions, along with a page that thanks them for their enquiry.

### Responsive Website

## **Beginning The Project**
### **Initial Idea**
After doing some research on clubs in the local area, and from personal experience in old clubs I used to attend, I knew that most Martial Art websites lacked a lot of basic structure. Most were extremely plain, with very little visual stimulation and hard to follow. I knew from this that my navigation would be key to ensuring new and returning customers could use my site quickly and efficiently, regardless of the device they were viewing it on. A lot of sites I looked into seemed to be over stimualted with information, and didn't make use of multiple pages for one site. I knew from this, that this would play a big part in my layout.

Below are some rough sketches that I drew by hand to start bringing my idea to life. From brain, to paper, to github! I must reiterate, these are *rough* sketches, I am no artist.

### **Thank You Page**
This page is something I came up with whilst doing further research during the project. I saw a lot of mention of it on Slack, and decided it would be a good feature to add in. Though the *'form'* doesn't actually go anywhere, it was a nice touch for the user to receive some visual feedback of their actions.
***

### **Colour Scheme**
A unique and eye popping color pallet created using *[coolors.co](https://coolors.co)*. Black, red and blue are the senior most colors in Taekwon-Do, so I thought it fitting that these should be represented in the website.
![color-scheme](readme-content/images/color-pallet.png)

I found that these colors matched surprisingly well with the logo I had decided to use on the homepage. This was, in all honesty, a happy coincidence that I had not planned for, however it made me realise the importance of ensuring no two colors clashed, and made me very aware of what colors I was using on each webpage going through the project.
***

### **Typography**
The headers on all pages throughout the Website are using the **"Oswald"** font, whilst the main text is using the **"Roboto"** font. Both of which are from google fonts, which can be found in the '[Technology Used](#Technology-Used)' section.

### **Images/Video**

The main logo for the site has been sourced from [Free Vector](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/jiu-jitsu-athletes-fighting-with-black-belts_10582157.htm#query=martial%20arts&position=34&from_view=search), which is a free picture site, so long as you source where you received the picture from.

## **During The Project**
### **Features on the site**
By planning out my ideas previously in the '[What I Intend To Include](#What-I-Intend-To-Include)' section, I was able to essentially 'tick-off' my plans whilst working my way through the project. This allowed me to more effecient throughout.

> The first bullet point was talking about designing an appealing homepage for a potential customer, and having a header and footer that linked to multiple pages and social media links.

* From the beginning, upon opening up the Website, a first time customer is greeted with a friendly cartoon image, a captivating couple of phrases that are straight to the point, and there's no doubting the name of the Website. All this combined ensures the first time user that they are indeed in the correct area.

* With the customer now reassured as to where they are, the header and footer of the Website are clearly visible and are a constant anchor, remaining the same, throughout all the Web pages. This allows the customer to navigate the site quickly and effeciently.

* To allow the customer some feedback, when a social media link is clicked, or hovered over, it will turn a different colour, indicating to the user what is happening.

  ![Nav-Bar](readme-content/images/nav-bar.png)

> In order to put the customer at ease that they would be attending the correct club for them, an *'about us'* section was essential.

* When the customer uses the navigation links to click on *'info'* they are greated with an about section which goes into a breif description of the club, how long it has been established, and how they are family oriented. As a first time customer, and potential new student, it is imperative that everyone feels comfortable approaching the club.

  ![About-Us](readme-content/images/about-us.png)

* For those who prefer to 'see it, not say it', there is a video clip also linked to this page, which the customer has full control of playing, pausing and adjusting the volume. **Please note; this video is purely fictious and is only a 5 second clip from a website linked in the [Credits](#Credits) section of this Readme file. It is purely for the sake of the project and does not contain any actual information on this fictious club.**

  ![Video](readme-content/images/video-info.png)

* Finally, for those who are new customers, or returning customers, there is a section dedicated to upcoming events. These events are a great way to open people up to new experiences, and potentially recruit new members to the club who may not have had the opportunity before. A great example of this, is the 'mothers day' event. Many children attend martial art clubs all over the country, and for legal and safety reasons, many parents stay and watch. With mothers day only a few months away, it could allow parents of members of the club a chance to partake in activities that they may not have thought of doing before. Again, providing the customer information that indicates that the club is friendly and family orientated.

> The times section of the website is an essential part of the website, as it allows for recurring traffic back to the Website.

* Whether a customer on the page is new, or a returning member, having a page that is dedicated to the times and locations of all classes, is a great way to boost traffic to the page. 

* A new customer may simply use it to look for the closest location to their home to debate starting up classes. Which allows them a certain freedom, knowing there is multiple locations, from which they can cater to their own needs.

* Whereas an existing member of the club may fancy a change of venue, and the quickest and easiest way to do this, is to visit the Website and use the *'times'* page.

  ![Times](readme-content/images/times.png)

> Though it is hoped that the previous pages would be sufficient information for new customers to decided whether or not the club is for them, a form page is also very essential for any further questions.

* The form section allows direct communication with the customer, which, for a small local martial arts club, is key to ensuring a long term client. The owner is able to put any worries at rest, and is able to partly meet the customer through email exchanges before they turn up to their first class. Which helps releive a lot of the pressure of turning up for the first time.

* It also allows for existing students to contact their tutor officially through the form, for any concerns, questions on upcoming events, or even to acquire extra help. It is a great way to keep traffic coming back to the site.
  
  ![Form](readme-content/images/form.png)

The above shows a little insight to what went through my mind in the reasonings behind the pages I decided to use for this project, and how to balance a new customer coming to the site, versus a recurring customer. As both are needed in order to run a successful site.

### **Technologies Used**
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
  - Used to give icons to the social media section of the footers. This provides a more visual stimulation for the user as they are already aware of what the icons stand for.

- [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/)
  - This site was used to come up with a colour scheme for the entire website.

- [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)
  - Once I was happy with the lay out of the site, this feature on Google Chrome was used heavily to figure out why certain code worked, and why other parts didn't. As I progressed further through the project, I found myself relying on this much more than I realised, and it most definitely helped to complete each page quicker than the last.

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
  - As mentioned in the [Typography](#Typgraphy) section, google fonts was used to provide a more unique look for the site.

- [HTML Checker](https://validator.w3.org/)
   - I ran all 5 pages through the HTML validator to ensure that the Web page ran smoothly with the correct code.

- [CSS Checker](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
  - Just like the HTML Checker, this site was used to ensure that my CSS passed the correct test results to be used to create an interoperable Web page.

- [Chromes Lighthouse Audit](https://web.dev/)
  - This service was used to check how my site worked in an overall capacity. The results of this, and the HTML & CSS Checkers, can be found in the [Testing](#Testing) section.
***
## **Completion Of The Website**
### **What else would I like to add?**
- I feel that adding in a *'Gallery'* page to the site would add a sense of unity with members of the club. To celebrate their goals and achievements, and allow potential new customers to see the family friendly side of the club and want to get involved themselves.
- I would also like to add a training section. Where members of the club are able to view videos of techniques used in class, to allow them to continue their training in the comfort of their own home.
***
### **Testing**
As mentioned in the above Technologies, I used HTML, CSS and a Performance Checker, to double check all my code, and how efficiently my site ran. The results of these can be found further below.

However I also went through each page to ensure that the customer would be able to use each one efficiently. By doing this I can confirm that the website is responsive and works well on all standard screen sizes, that the text on each web page is readable and easy to understand and finally I can confirm that the form works and requires the user to enter the correct information on each field.
### **Validators**
#### **HTML Validator**
Eventually I was able to receive the *'No errors or warnings to show'* message, after a couple tweaks to the coding on different pages. I will go into more detail in the *'[Bugs](#bugs)'* section.
![HTML Checker](readme-content/images/html-checker.png)
***
There were a couple of bugs in my CSS Styling, however these were either a spelling mistake, or a space missing in the code, very basic human error, so easily amended.
![CSS Checker](readme-content/images/CSS-checker.png)
***
According to other members of the 'Slack' community, this audit (though an official site) performs better using an 'incognito' mode, however I ran my website through in a normal browser and was still happy with the outcome, which is what you see below. 
![Performance-Checker](readme-content/images/Performance-Checker.png)
***
### **Bugs**
#### **Current**
There is a slight styling issue with the background image when used on much larger screens. There tends to be a large white space at the bottom of some pages. I believe this to be due to the size of the image being used as the background. At this stage I am not planning on amending this, as it does not affect the average user. If I were to notice this again, I would either changed the background image to allow for a more varied background height, or use @media queries to stretch the picture ever so slightly, to ensure the customer still has a good experience, without distorting the image too much.
***
#### **Resolved**
After using the HTML validator I encountered a few errors which I had to correct in order to achieve the 'no errors' message. As mentioned in the [HTML Validator](#HTML-Validator) Such as follows;
#### **Info Page Errors**
![Info-Errors](readme-content/images/info-errors.png)
  1. The stray end tag was easy enough to remove, which removed this error.
  2. I was not aware that list elements were not allowed to be inside a div, so I changed this to a simple 'ul' for unlisted. However this led me into my next error;
![Info-Errors2](readme-content/images/info-errors2.png)
  3. I should have seen this coming, unfortunately I was not feeling my brightest when I changed 'li' to 'ul'. To fix this error I changed all the 'ul' to 'p' instead, and adapted my CSS code to accomdate the same styles the 'li' orginally had, but with 'p' instead. Though it is not what I wanted, it provided me with the same result.

#### **Enquire page**
![Enquiry Errors](readme-content/images/enquiry-errors.png)
The original code had 'text' rather than 'textarea' which needed a value. However, 'textarea' did not, so simply removing the 'value="Further Questions?"' from the line of code, solved this error.
***

### **Personal Difficulties**
As this was my first project I did stumble onto a lot of difficulties, many of which were easily resolved. These included simple typing errors, or a misplaced hashtag/full stop etc. I frequently ploughed through my difficulties and occasionally forgot to take note of what I struggled with, this is something I will recitfy for my next project, as looking back on previous problems allows me to see how far I have actually come in terms of understanding coding.

That being said, there were some difficulties that stood out amongst the others due to the length of time in which it took me to figure them out.

  1. I orignally had a different background for each web page, however after talking to my Mentor, he mentioned that the pictures I was using were more for viewing purposes, rather than a background image. That being said one of the images was continuously out of place, and 'cut off' the heads of the people in the photo,
    * This was because I had set my photo to 'center center' which meant no matter how much I changed the margin or padding, the picture always remained center. This took me an embarrasingly long time to figure out. However after talking to another member of the slack community, David Horrocks, he pointed out the line of code in question and informed me he changed very little to get the desired results. By singling out the one line of code, I realised all I had to do was change 'center center' to 'top center'.
    * Though this bug never made the final cut due to changing the background imagery completely, it really helped my understanding how how to use background images correctly.

  2. At the very beginning of the project, I remember struggling with the Navigation links at the top of the page not being in a straight line. (As I've mentioned previously, I do not have screenshots of this as, begin my first project, it didn't occur to me to take consistent screenshots for later use). However I remember it coming down to me setting my CSS Styling incorrectly, and having one link with extra padding than the other three. Simple mistake, but took me a long while to figure out. Eventually I used the 'Google Chrome Dev Tool' to pin point the mistake.

  3. The biggest difficulty of all, was the fact I originally made my website 'computer first' instead of 'mobile first'. This led to me having to readjust a LOT of code. Fortunately it didn't take me too long to reorder it, cut and paste is now a good friend of mine! But I will not be making this mistake again. It is much easier to increase the sizes from mobile to computer than the other way around.

  4. Finally when it came down to @media queries, I misunderstood the *code insitutes* presentation and for some reason started at 1280px and worked downwards. This was a very idiotic mistake, but when I noticed this mistake I quick rectified it and found that my code, miraculously, worked much better.
***

### **Deployment**
Github allows for a very simple deployment of websites. In order to do this, please follow the steps below;

1. Open repository on Github
2. Go to settings
3. Choose pages
4. Click to "Branch" and choose "main"
5. Then click "Save"
6. Finally, click the link.

You will have to wait a number of minutes to allow the website to full generate, however this is not something I can control, as it is to do with Github.

### **Acknowledgements**

I would like to say a special thank you to two members of the slack community espeically, David Horrocks and David Bowers. Both helped with multiple issues when I found myself just starring at the code unable to figure it out.
I would also like to thank my mentor Spencer Barribell for his help with this project, his advice was very insightful. He also took time out of his personal schedule to help me when I was unable to book in an appointment.

### ** Comments **
Though this project was a struggle at times, I have thoroughly enjoyed it, and it has been a great experience. It has advanced my understanding of HTML and CSS considerably, and I hope to only improve upon it in the following months.

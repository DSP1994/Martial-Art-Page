## **Basic Overview**

This is my first full, and marked, project through the code institute course. I have been tasked with making a front end website using basic code that I have learnt over the last month, including HTML and CSS.

For this I have decided to design a website based off a hobby close to my heart, Taekwon-Do, after having practiced this sport for almost 20 years.
